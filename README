= Zliby:  Pure Ruby Zlib 
=== Version Information
Release:: 0.0.2
Description:: A Ruby 1.8.6 Zlib compatible module.
Reference:: Zlib[http://www.zlib.net] 1.2.3

== Introduction

Zliby is an implmention of the Zlib[http://www.zlib.net] library written in 
pure Ruby.  It is meant to be API compatible with the existing Ruby Zlib 
extension library. The purpose of this library was two-fold:

1. To see if it could be done
2. To provide IronRuby[http://www.ironruby.net] with a compatible Zlib 
   implementation

While IronRuby[http://www.ironruby.net] was the inspirition for this project,
the fact that it's written in pure Ruby means any Ruby implementation should
benefit. 

=== Acknowledgements

The deflate implmentation is essentially a port of puff.c from the Zlib[http://www.zlib.net]
implementation by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.  All due praise should be 
directed their way.
